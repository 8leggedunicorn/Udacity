\section*{Introduction}
So the stage is set with the following description for the Stroop experiment:
\begin{quote}
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with
each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant's task is to say
out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has
two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words
condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed
are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed:
for example {\color{red} RED }, {\color{blue} BLUE }. In the incongruent words condition, the words
fisplayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which
they are printed: for example { \color{yellow}PURPLE }, {\color{green} ORANGE}. In each case, we measure
the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each
participant will go through and record a time from each condition.
\cite{Udacity-P1-Stroop}
\end{quote}
This project attempts to follow the outline provided in \cite{Udacity-P1-Stroop}
and the project rubrick set forth in \cite{Udacity-P1-rubrick}.
\sectiontitle{Identify variables in the experiment}
{
\label{sec:question1}
What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?}
  incongruency between the color of a word, and the semantic meaning of the
  word.  As example the word {\color{red}`RED'} is a congruent example where the
  word `red' has the color of its semantic meaning, i.e. the color it
  represents, and {\color{green}`BLUE'} is an incongruent case where the word
  `blue' which has the semantic meaning of the color blue is instead the color
  green. Frome here on out the terms congruent color selection, CCS, and
incongruent color selection, ICS, will be used to denote the two conditions the
dependent variable may take that of a word representing a color being colored
with or with a different color respectively.

The dependent variable is the time, in seconds, it takes to read through an
equal sized lists of CCS or ICS words.  
\sectiontitle{Establish a hypothesis and statistical test}{\label{sec:question2}
What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical
test do you expect to perform? 
Justify your choices.}

The null hypothesis, \(H_0\) is the statement that the ICS task will take less
or an equal amount of time to the CCS task. The alternative hypothesis, \(H_A\)
is the statement that the mean population time to read an ICS list will be
greater than an equally sized CCS list. The null and alternative hypothesis
choice stems from a need to test quantatively the validity and extent of an
already well respected phenomenon the Stroop effect. The Stroop effect being
defined to mean that cognitive incongruences will lead to an increase in the
reaction time of a task.\\ It is true that this single tailed objective may not
provide insight if indeed the reaction time for ICS word lists take, on the
average, less time to complete, however this is a test regarding the scope and
veracity of the Stroop effect which has been shown in many previous quantative
tests to have general validity. If indeed the ICS task takes less time it is
enough that \(H_0\) should be kept to cause doubt regarding the validity of
either the test or the Stroop effect.  That is due to the large body of work
already done to test the effect if \(H_0\) is kept there is either something
wrong with the experiment or the Stroop effect has either more limitations on
generalizability than expected or there are indeed real issues with it's
veracity. So to sum things up via a set of equations:

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:null_hypothesis}
  H_0:\; \mu_{ICS} \le \mu_{CCS} \\
  \label{eq:alternative_hypothesis}
  H_A:\; \mu_{ICS} > \mu_{CCS}
\end{align}
As the two sets of data are correlated, the same subjects are used to take both
the ICS and CCS tests, the proper test to use is a dependent t-test for paired
samples.  Given the hypothesis devised above the single tail test will be used.

\sectiontitle{Report descriptive statistics}{
  \label{sec:question3}
Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset.
Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability.}

In \autoref{fig:descriptive_data_describe} is printed the mean, sample standard deviation, minimum values,
25th, 50th - median, 75th percentiles, and maximums for both the CCS
and ICS samples, all values are in seconds. 
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \input{charts/data_describe}
  \caption{The source code for the table may be found:
    \href{https://github.com/8leggedunicorn/p1_stroop_effect/blob/master/p1_stroop_effect.py\#L1-L13}
        {p1\_stroop\_effect.py}.
      The above table was generated with help from official PANDAS API
      documentation as follows:
    \cite{PANDAS-csv}, \cite{PANDAS-to-latex}, \cite{PANDAS-describe-df}}
  \label{fig:descriptive_data_describe}
\end{figure}
\begin{center}
\end{center}
To measure the central tendency consider the mean, and the median - which in this
case is simply the 50th percentile. Notice the fact that for both CCS and ICS
the median and mean are nearly identical, for the CCS case it's less than one
third of a second difference, and for the ICS case the difference between these
two measure of central tendency is only slightly greater than a second. This
points to both distribution being evenly distributed around the mean. As we can
see for nearly all percentiles, minimum and maximum, and mean values the CCS
times are roughly two thirds of the value of the ICS times, and all times for
every category are significantly longer for the ICS sample relative to the CCS.

An indication of the relative spread can be observed by looking at the sample
standard deviations. the ICS case is slightly more spread out than the CCS case
\(4.797s\) to \(3.559s\) respectively, i.e slightly over a second more for the
ICS sample. To gain a better descriptive understanding of the spread we can also
look at the range, i.e.  \(R = x_{max} - x_{min}\) of the two samples:

\begin{align*}
R_{CCS} = x_{CCS,max} - x_{CCS,min} = 22.328000 - 8.630000 = 13.698\\
R_{ICS} = x_{ICS,max} - x_{ICS,min} = 35.255000 - 15.687000 = 19.568
\end{align*}

From both the sample standard deviation and the range we can see that the spread
of the ICS sample is greater both in terms of the range, i.e.~outliers, and of
the sample standard deviation:

\sectiontitle{Plot the data}
{\label{sec:question4}
Provide one or two visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data.
Write one or two sentences noting what you observe about the plot or plots.}

\autoref{fig:bar-graph-ccs-vs-ics-times} points to the same ideas described
in the descriptive statistics presented in the previous section. There are no
real outliers for the CCS case, which shows up in the difference in the standard
deviations of the two samples above, and that the mean and median for the CCS
case are very close together.  What is interesting to note, however is that the
two greatest times for the ICS are from subjects who take no where near the
longest for the CCS trial. Subject 20 having the second greatest ICS time isn't
even to the right of the mean.  This graph also explicitly shows that each
subject takes a greater ICS time than their CCS time, there being no exceptions.

  \caption{Bar graph of the time to complete the CCS and ICS list for each

    \href{https://github.com/8leggedunicorn/p1_stroop_effect/blob/master/p1_stroop_effect.py}{p1\_stroop\_effect.py}

  \label{fig:bar-graph-ccs-vs-ics-times}
\end{figure}
One might think naively especially in the case of the CCS descriptive
statistics that both data sets show an evenly distributed nature, however
looking at the two histogram graphs, \autoref{fig:ICS-histogram} and
\autoref{fig:CCS-histogram}, it becomes very clear that both are heavily
skewed to the left, with the two outliers on the right hand side for the ICS
case increasing the standard deviation dramatically
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figures/histogram-ccs}
  \caption{The graph above is a histogram of the CCS data.  Note how it is
  skewed heavily to the left.  This is due to the two outliers with times
  greater than $32s$.}
  \label{fig:CCS-histogram}
\end{figure}
As the sample size is not too great, it doesn't even exceed the minimum rule of
thumb of thirty, and as such the shape of the population distribution isn't
implied in the obviously left skewed sample distributions for both CCS and ICS,
nor is the Central Limit Theorem to be relied upon given the sample size.  So
over generalizing is a bit too easy at this point, however even after removing
the outliers in the ICS case, please see
\autoref{fig:ICS-no-outliers-histogram}, it is difficult to come to any
definitvie conclusion about the distribution - only that the times are greater
than the CCS data set.

\sectiontitle{Perform the statistical test and interpret your results}{
\label{sec:question5}
Now, perform the statistical test and report your results.  What is your
confidence level and your critical statistic value?  Do you reject the null
hypothesis or fail to reject it?  Come to a conclusion in terms of the
experiment task. Did the results match up with your expectations?} 

The test to be performed is a \textit{t} Test for Correlated Groups.  That is a
test where the subjects of both groups remain the same and it's the independent
variable CCS/ICS tests that distinguish one set of data from the other.  For
guidance concerning which test to apply I referenced the fine research methods
book \cite{jackson2011research}.  As stated in \autoref{sec:question2} I believe
both one and two sided tests can legitimately be argued for, however if this is
a test regarding the Stroop effect only the one tailed test defined by the
hypothesi discussed again in \autoref{sec:question2} i.e.
\autoref{eq:null_hypothesis} and \autoref{eq:alternative_hypothesis} are
reasonable.  Both \autoref{sec:question3} and \autoref{sec:question4} point to a
statistically significant difference between the two data sets, and in this
section the math is performed to show this, and quantatatively to what extent.  

I have used the SciPy package to calculate the \text{t} value
\cite{Scipy-ttest-rel}.  Below are the calculations as well as the results to
this method:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{python}
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import scipy as sp
    import scipy.stats
    from math import sqrt
    stroopdata = pd.read_csv('stroopdata.csv')
    print(scipy.stats.ttest_rel(stroopdata['Congruent'],stroopdata['Incongruent']))
    (-8.020706944109957, 4.1030005857111781e-08)
  \end{python}
  \caption{Calculation of the two-tail correlated \textit{t} test shows that the
  the null hypothesis should be rejected.  That is $\mu_{ICS} > \mu_{CCS}$. For
syntax highlighting, as I'm using {pdf\LaTeX}, I used additional assistance from
\cite{LaTeX-listings-python}.}
  \label{fig:reject-null-hypothesis}
\end{figure}
So to interpret the results.  The first number obtained,
$-8.020706944109957$ is the \textit{t} value for the test and the second is the
corresponding $p$ value.  That is the population mean, $\mu_{ICS}$ for the ICS
data set is greater than the $\mu_{CCS}$ ( $\mathit{t} = -8.020706944109957$ at
$p = 4.1030005857111781e-08$ ), an exceedingly unlikely occurrence, four in
one-hundred million chance to occur if $\mu_{ICS}$ was in fact less than or
equal to $\mu_{CCS}$.  Which means the test results points to $H_A$ being the
only acceptable hypothesis to accept, with almost nill chance of a Type I
error. 

The quantative results matched up well with the descriptive and inferential
statistics discussed in sections \autoref{sec:question3} and
\autoref{sec:question4}.  The degree to which the null hypothesis must be
rejected after looking at the results of this test paint the stark difference
between these two data sets.
\sectiontitle{Digging deeper and extending the investigation}{
\label{sec:question6}
  What do you think is responsible for the effects observed?
  Can you think of an alternative or similar task that would result in a similar
  effect?  Some research about the problem will be helpful for thinking about these two questions!}

There is a concise but equally inspired webpage that goes into the possible ways
of viewing the Stroop effect, see \cite{Stroop-background}.  What follows I
cannot take credit for and must rely on the previously cited reference.  They
list three models explaining why the effect occurs: the automatic word
recognition (AWR) model , speed of processing (SP) model, and a parallel
distribued processing (PDP) model.  

I will briefly describe these three models.  The AWR is the claim that humans
are hard wired for language and in this case word recognition.  That is we are
hard wired to process words in a certain manner, i.e. the meaning of a printed
word takes prescedence over the color of the printed word.  The evidence for
this model is due to the robust nature of the Stroop effect.  That the ICS
sample always has a greater mean than the CCS sample, regardless of practice.
That the use of color related words such as 'sky' or 'firetruck', to words that
sound like color words such as 'wred' and 'bloo' all behave in accordance with
the Stroop effect.  So the AWR model claims that in essence the Stroop effect is
due to how humans process information.  That is we have a biological tendency to
focus on, have a precedence for, semantic meaning over observable traits, like
color.

The SP model makes the claim that certain neural pathways are simply faster than
others.  That the reading pathway is faster than the color processing pathway.
As such it takes longer for the brain work out the conflicting messages and use
the later arriving information regarding the color of the printed word over its
semantic meaning.  This is a poor example but I will use it anyways.  Lightning
to our eyes arrives faster than thunder to our ears.  This is due to the nature
of the medium that the energy is passing through.  The metaphor breaks down
quickly but it's an easy way of seeing the idea in practice.

Finally the PDP model claims that it's not so much a matter of speed as in the
SP model but a matter of the strengths of the cognitive pathways of each.  That
is on the whole the pathway for reading is stronger and therefore takes
presedence not because it arrives at the conscious decision making parts of our
brain but because it makes more of an impact, so that in turn it requires more
from us to focus in on the fainter observation of the color of the printed
letters.

The Wikipedia article on this subject \cite{Stroop-wikipedia}, is far more
exhaustive in its description.  It discusses the possible biological basis of
the phenomenon, and provides good research references.  Instead of parroting any
further explication I will consider an experiment not in this article I thought
would be interesting.

While originally I thought up the experiement on my own a bit of searching found
that research had naturally already pushed into this area
\cite{Stroop-dyslexia}.  The only change to the normal Stroop effect would be to
use experimental subjects all of whom had dyslexia, and a control of random but
similarly aged readers.  It seems to me that likely the dyslexic would have an
easier time saying the name of the color of a certain printed word over reading
the word which if it occurred would violate the Stroop effect.  Studying the
causes might hopefully shed light on why exactly the Stroop effect occurs, and
provide more insight into dyslexia.  Oddly what the researchers found in the
referenced study is however just the opposite to the one I naively 
hypothesized.  Namely the children with dyslexia had an even more pronounced
Stroop effect than normal readers in their age group.  

What is obvious is that the continuous advances in technology should help in
understanding what the basis is for the Stroop effect.  Another experiment is
using a technology that isn't quite here but is a stone's throw away that of
modern brain reading, or making correlations between uses of particular areas of
the brain and our thoughts which in the last decade has really progressed
immensly, see \cite{Brain-to-text} as an example.  Using this technology we
would likely be able to see exactly where the extra time was coming from.  Then
again if real mind reading becomes a reality in any practical sense it likely
would have far greater reaching effects but it's something to look forward to.
