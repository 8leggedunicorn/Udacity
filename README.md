## To Udacity Staff
  * This is a repository for the old P2 project: Analyze the NYC Subway Dataset.
  * The PDF file 'p2_analyze_the_NYC_sd.pdf' is the completed project.
  * There was a corruption with the BibTex database at roughly 3:33PM CST December 4th, if you clone the project earlier than this please update.

## Build from Source

**__The script is currently broken as it was taken from P1 and needs additional work to be used with P2.  More work needs to be used to transfer the IPython notebooks to Python code so that automation can work.__**
To build the paper you will need a pretty full Python 3 distribution, for
instance the Anaconda project using Python 3 will do, as well as a relatively
complete TeX installation.

To build run the following commands:

```bash
p2_analyze_the_NYC_sd.py -f # creates the figures
p2_analyze_the_NYC_sd.py -c # creates the charts
p2_analyze_the_NYC_sd.py -pdf # creates the PDF 
```

## Skill set needed to become a data scientist:
Venn Diagram of necessary data science skills:
 * Hacking Skills
 * Math & Statistics Knowledge
 * Substantive Expertise

## Describe 'substantive expertise' by the following:
 * Knows which questions to ask.
 * Can interpret the data well.
 * Understand the structure of the data.
 * Caveat Data scientists often work in teams so while substantive knowledge is
 important having less subject knowledge can often times be mitigated by
 divvying out tasks to those who are best able to complete them.
