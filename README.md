# What is this?
This is the first project for the Udacity nanodegree in data analysis.  

To build the paper you will need a pretty full Python 3 distribution, for
instance the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) project using Python 3 will do, as well as a relatively
complete TeX installation.

To build run the following commands:
```bash
p1_stroop_effect.py -f # creates the figures
p1_stroop_effect.py -c # creates the charts
p1_stroop_effect.py -pdf # creates the PDF 
```
# The project is meant to be built using the python 

## Personal scores on the Stroop test:

* 11.169s congruent (color same to word)
* 10.227s Incongruent (color different to word)

Apparently priming has a demonstrable affect on this test for me although this doesn't appear to be the case for the greater population looking at the available data.
